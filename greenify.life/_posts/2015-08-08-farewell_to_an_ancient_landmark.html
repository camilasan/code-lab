It linked Sheffield to the villages of northern Derbyshire and beyond the western moors ringing the horizon to Manchester. There are still worn flags or “pitchings” in a few places, laid in the eighteenth century as horse-drawn carts were replacing pack animals. On the crest of the moor is a tall wooden pole to help the weary and confused navigate in driving rain or blowing snow.</p><p>Or at least, there used to be. As I toiled uphill, something was nagging at me, but only when the wide views of the Derbyshire moors opened out did I realise what it was. The pole had gone.
